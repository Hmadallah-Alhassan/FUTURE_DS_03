# FUTURE_DS_03
Use data science to improve campus life! This project analyzes student feedback from campus events using pandas, TextBlob, and visualizations in Google Colab. Includes sentiment analysis and satisfaction trend tracking to guide future improvements.

# 🎓 Campus Feedback Sentiment Analysis

Use data science to improve campus life! This project shows how to turn student feedback into actionable insights using real-world tools like Google Colab, pandas, and TextBlob — no coding background needed.

## 🔍 Project Overview

College events like tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities collect feedback — but are we using it meaningfully?

In this internship project, we analyze student feedback (ratings and comments) submitted after campus events. Using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP), we extract sentiment and uncover satisfaction trends to help organizers improve future events.

## 🎯 What You’ll Do

- ✅ Clean and prepare feedback data from a Google Form (CSV)
- ✅ Analyze 1–5 rating patterns
- ✅ Score comment sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative
- ✅ Visualize trends with bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds
- ✅ Recommend improvements based on the data

## 🧠 Skills You’ll Gain

- Data cleaning and analysis with **pandas**
- Sentiment analysis using **TextBlob** or **VADER**
- Charting with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Word cloud generation for text insights
- Working with **Google Colab** (no install needed)

## 📁 Data Source

- Simulated or exported Google Form (CSV)

## 📊 Example Insights

- Most students found workshops helpful but wanted more hands-on sessions.
- Feedback sentiment on cultural events was mostly positive.
- Sessions rated low often lacked clear presentations or follow-up.
